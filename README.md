# Automatic_Folder_Cleaner
This project is for those people who have so many files in a folder but not sorted in a proper manner. 
This python project is created by using the `os` module and separate file format by using the def functions  
By simply clicking on the python application the folder sorted properly by making new folders separately for formatted files 
like: FOLDER Images for .jpg .jpeg .png etc 
      FOLDER Video for .mp4 .gif .webm etc
